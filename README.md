##Check that the version in development is greater than the last existing tag:
In order to check that the version in development is greater than the last existing tag it is necessary to run the following rake task:
```ruby
qat:devel:gitlab:check_version_tags
```
##DoD code documentation metric:
In order to DoD(Definition of Done) code documentation metric it is necessary to run the following rake task:
```ruby
qat:devel:validate_yard_doc[project]
```
##DoD code static analysis metric:
In order to DoD(Definition of Done) code static analysis metric it is necessary to run the following rake task:
```ruby
